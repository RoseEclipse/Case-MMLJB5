        <p>December 25, 1945. Five children vanished without a trace.</p>
        <p>The fire should have destroyed everything. But the bodies were never found.</p>
        <p>For decades, the truth has been buried. Files erased. Witnesses silenced.</p>
        <p><b>You were not supposed to find this.</b></p>

        <p class="hidden">They are not gone. Look closer.</p>
